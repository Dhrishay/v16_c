                            <h3 >YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
                            <p>Our website uses plug-ins of the YouTube platform, which is being
                                operated by YouTube,
                                LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
                            </p>
                            <p>We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to
                                YouTube, this mode
                                ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website
                                before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the
                                sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data
                                protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube
                                will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.
                            </p>
                            <p>As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on our website, a connection
                                to YouTube’s
                                servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of
                                our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit
                                our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your
                                personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube
                                account.
                            </p>
                            <p>Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able
                                to place
                                various cookies on your device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be
                                able to obtain information about our website visitor. Among other things, this
                                information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user
                                friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud. These cookies will
                                stay on your device until you delete them.

                            <p>Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may
                                be triggered
                                after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.

                            <p>The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online
                                content in an
                                appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest.

                            <p>We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter referred to as “reCAPTCHA”) on our
                                websites. The
                                provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
                                (“Google”).
                            </p>
                            <p>The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to determine whether data entered on our
                                websites (e.g.
                                information entered into a contact form) is being provided by a human user or by an
                                automated program. To determine this, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website
                                visitors based on a variety of parameters. This analysis is triggered automatically as
                                soon as the website visitor enters the site. For this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates a
                                variety of data (e.g. IP address, time the website visitor spent on the site or cursor
                                movements initiated by the user). The data tracked during such analyses are forwarded to
                                Google.
                            </p>
                            <p>reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are
                                not alerted that

                            <p>The data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. It is
