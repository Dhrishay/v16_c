About
============
Currently in odoo for quotation and sales order one sequence no managed. so it's difficult to identify quotations or sell orders based on sequence number generated. so our module helps to overcome this issue this module will help you to manage both sequences separately. So you will be easy to filter both as well. Another thing we have done in this module, default odoo when we click on the quotation menu it was showing all orders without filtering specific quotation orders. so we have made this quotation menu only show you quotation state list instead of quotation plus sale order list. After confirming to sale order still, you will be having a reference of quotation in another info tab. so you can track that as well.

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list. 
5) search module name and hit install button.
